title: On Polytheism

Theism in general is a magnificent beast. From the monotheistic viewpoint that
there is but one God, and only one God, to the polytheistic viewpoint that
there could very well be many gods, even those that you don't believe in, the
contrast is staggering. In this article we'll analyse Greer's _A World Full of
Gods_ and suggest that based on a number of factors the polytheistic world view
'makes sense.' Our arguments for polytheism are best described by Greer's book
_A World Full of Gods_. So for a more in-depth analysis of the concepts talked
about in this article it's highly recommended to consult Greer's book. In
saying that, a concise introduction to what polytheism is and why it's relevant
can be found in Greer's book.

Naturally the emphasised portion of the quote is what rings true of many
polytheists. The _Sacred_ by itself basically means nothing when espoused by
traditional monotheists and its merely a symbol for what the traditional
monotheist considers a great symbol of their god. This comes about when a god
of monotheistic tradition is put under scrutiny. What can be claimed is mostly
in the negative rather than the positive. 'God is beyond being' is a classical
example of a statement about the monotheistic god, but what does that leave one
with to worship? Positive claims are equally dubious. 'God is omnipotent,' 'God
is omniscience,' 'God is omni-benevolent,' all these claims when put together
leave one wanting. Mental gymnastics have to be performed to believe in an
all-powerful, all-knowing, always-good God that allows evil and suffering. The
same cannot be said about polytheism.

Polytheism on the contrary adopts the notion that its gods are not
all-powerful, all-knowing, and aren't always good. They may be superhuman yet
much like us they have strengths and flaws, they have virtues and vices,
basically they're a lot like us. This concept of flawed gods avoids many of the
arguments made against monotheism and religion in general. Some classic
examples is the aforementioned 'problem of evil' and the 'argument from
inconsistent revelation,' 'destiny of the un-evangelised,' 'argument from poor
design,' and the 'argument from non-belief.' All these arguments can't be
applied against gods that aren't all-powerful, aren't all-knowing, and that
aren't always good. For all intents and purposes polytheism holds a stronger,
more realistic world view than its monotheistic counterpart.

The core argument in Greer's _A World Full of Gods_ is that of cats, yes, cats.
The argument revolves around the idea of a village and the villagers singular
belief about cats, or more specifically, about a single entity called 'Cat.'
The first villager says that Cat is one thing, the second villager another
thing about Cat and disagrees on the nature of Cat that first villager
proposes. The third villager however believes in Cat but also accepts that
others could have differing opinions of Cat. The fourth villager thinks its all
a farce and that Cat, or even cats, don't exist. The fifth villager knows that
there are many cats and believes in all their existence.

The striking thing about this analogy of Cat is that each of the first three
villagers, the monofelists, worship Cat in different ways and believe their
worship to be the 'one true way.' The fifth villager on the other hand is a
polyfelist and worships Cat, or more appropriately 'cats,' in a variety of ways
that's accepting of the previous three villagers beliefs. The fourth villager,
an afelist, doesn't believe in Cat or cats though this is a strong instance of
'special pleading' which is a core argument that Greer makes against atheism.
We for example know there's cats, many different kinds of cats in fact, and to
not have seen a cat doesn't prove their non-existence. But this leads to a very
important question, what evidence do we have for the gods?

There are a number of types of hypotheses for theism but Greer claims the
following.

> The absolute, rock-bottom hypothesis common to monotheism, polytheism, and
> most other forms of religion is the assertion that interactions between gods
> and human beings can be beneficial to the latter. This assertion is testable
> by the scientific method; that is, falsifiable hypotheses can be derived from
> it, and those hypotheses can be put to the test.

That is, religious experience is a real thing and all those people claiming
religious experience of various natures can't all be wrong. To deny that is to
deny what can be a very beneficial aspect of the human experience. Therefore
one can claim that religious experience, and its many benefits, alone is enough
to justify the gods and religion in general. Greer goes further in discussing
the infallibility of science in saying that the method doesn't justify the
means, or more specifically the system of belief, at any particular point in
time. Which is similar to polytheism in a sense. There's a method by which one
can swear by but that doesn't justify the system of belief at any particular
point in time. Systems of belief change, systems of belief evolve, which is
just what the practitioners of modern Heathenry accommodate when they try to
bring pre-Christian Germanic traditions into a contemporary context.

Overall I think Greer's book is a fantastic read and implore others to give it
a run through if they're curious about polytheism. In addition to the topics
covered here Greer also goes into the nature of myth and its meaning, various
aspects of polytheistic belief such as worship, ethics, time, eschatology, and
how the gods change through the ages.
