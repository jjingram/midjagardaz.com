The Ingvaeones, the Irminones, also referred to as the Herminones, and the
Istvaeones were three Germanic tribes. The Ingvaeones inhabited the coastal
regions of the North Sea, the Irminones lived around the Elbe watershed, and
the Istvaeones lived near the banks of the Rhine. As noted in the
aforementioned quote, each tribe had a legendary ancestor, each a son of
Mannus. The Ingvaeones' legendary ancestor derived his name from the Germanic
god *Ingwaz. How the Irminones' legendary ancestor's name is derived is a
little less direct. The Old Norse form of Irmin is Jörmunr, which appears in a
number of places in the _Poetic Edda_, which is one of the epithets of
*Wōdanaz. Therefore the legendary ancestor of the Irminones could have derived
his name from *Wōdanaz. Snorri Sturluson even alludes to at the beginning of
his _Prose Edda_ that *Wōdanaz's cult first appeared in Germany then spread up
to the Ingvaeonic North. The Istaevones' legendary ancestor's name has been
derived from unknown sources.

The tribes deriving their names from their legendary ancestor, who subsequently
derived their names from the gods, could allude to principal gods of worship
amongst the respective tribes. However, interweaving of each tribe's belief
could be suggested by the fact that *Wōdanaz/Mercury was, by the time of
Tacitus in the late first century, supreme deity.

This could lead to speculation that the Irminones' god *Wōdanaz had either more
appealing characteristics than the other gods or was forcefully made supreme
deity. *Wōdanaz derives from the Proto-Germanic *wōdaz ('excited, energised,
spirited, frenzied, obsessed,' or 'agitated, furious, angry') which strongly
suggests that *Wōdanaz in Proto-Germanic times was seen in a similar vein to
his Norse counterpart Odin. Odin's wife Frigg, who is derived from *Frijjō, was
god of love and home. Similar to Odin's association with war and poetry, Frigg
is associated with love and the home; a perfect counterpart to *Wōdanaz and his
wandering ways having been associated with the Roman Mercury. *Frijjō itself is
related to *frijōną ('to love') and she is likened to the Roman Venus, who was
the goddess of love, beauty, and female fertility.

*Tīwaz/Mars and *Þunraz/Hercules were also gods of war alongside *Wōdanaz. It's
been suggested by scholars based on the etymology of *Tīwaz's name, notably
derived from the Proto-Indo-European *deywós ('god'), that *Tīwaz once held a
more prominent position in Germanic mythology. However, given that *Tīwaz is a
proper noun, the meaning of his name wouldn't be 'a god' but '_the_ god.' Given
the root of *deywós, notably *dyew- ('sky, heaven'), it's hypothesised that
*Tīwaz was associated with the sky or the heavens. Parallels can be drawn
between *Tīwaz and the Proto-Baltic *Deivas as well as Zeus and Jupiter. All
were designated 'Sky Father' by their respective worshippers. Of particular
note is the relationship between a 'Sky Father' and the corresponding 'Earth
Mother.' This could lead to speculation that Tuisco, 'an earth-born god,' is
the son of *Tīwaz and the 'Earth Mother.' However, it leads to reason that the
other gods, namely *Austrǭ, *Frijjō, *Ingwaz, *Wōdanaz, and *Þunraz, were more
appealing to the Germanic tribes than an impersonal, creator god who has a
shadowy presence by the time of the Viking Age. Similar to *Deivas, *Tīwaz for
all intents and purposes could have been tending to his estate in heaven,
growing crops, and brewing beer after setting the world in motion.

*Austrǭ, for example, who derives her name from the Proto-Indo-European term
that means 'dawn,' or 'to dawn,' was known as Ēostre to the Anglo-Saxons with a
corresponding month named after her during spring. This notion of spring and
fertility would have been important to the Proto-Germanics. Far more important
than the creation of the world would have been the sustenance of its people.
*Austrǭ, along with *Ingwaz, would have been symbols of life itself. In a
similar vein, though with less etymological backing, is *Ingwaz who has the
Anglo-Saxon Ing and the Norse Yngvi as derived terms. Ing and Yngvi were most
likely older theonyms for the Norse god Freyr who was notable for his
association with virility and prosperity, with sunshine and fair weather, and
male fertility. Again, important notions for those that lived off the land.

*Þunraz, on the other hand, literally meaning 'thunder,' was both a god of war
and one of fertility. His Norse counterpart is Thor, a hammer-wielding god
associated with thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, the protection
of mankind, and also hallowing and fertility. *Þunraz has been likened to
Jupiter though without the supreme deity aspect and more the war and fertility
aspects. *Þunraz is reasonably likened to fertility given that he's the god of
storms, bringer of rain. A god that depicts both war and fertility would have
been an important aspect of Proto-Germanic worship and we see this through the
'Pillars of Hercules' erected in his honour. The idea of a god of both war and
fertility is cross-functional and ties everything together nicely.

With the six gods discussed, what can be deduced from this discussion is that
war and fertility were important aspects of Proto-Germanic worship. This leads
one to suppose that they were core parts of Proto-Germanic life and their
deities reflect this. It's hard to say what moment of Proto-Germanic culture
we're snapshotting because all these gods are reconstructed. Perhaps *Ingwaz
did start as an Ingvaeonic deity and was later adopted by the other Germanic
tribes. The same can be said about *Wōdanaz who could have originated as the
Irminonic supreme deity that then became supreme deity of the other Germanic
tribes through perhaps war or trade. Unfortunately this is all speculation
with most sources open to interpretation.
