**Notice:** This site is a work in progress.
{: .notice--info }

Welcome to Midjagardaz! A site dedicated to a reconstruction of Proto-Germanic
traditions. Here you'll find information pertaining to Proto-Germanic gods,
wights, and rituals.

There isn't much literary evidence for Proto-Germanic traditions so the major
goal will be to pull from comparative mythology, linguistics, and archaeology.
There will be scholarly and sound inference to give the reconstruction
substance.

**Warning!** The author of this site has no formal qualifications in
linguistics, history, or relgion, just a fascination with the subjects.
