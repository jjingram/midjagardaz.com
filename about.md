Hello, I'm Jarrod Jeffrey Ingram and this is my little site I've constructed
for my reconstructions of Germanic traditions. It should be noted that I have
no formal qualifications in the arts, including linguistics, history, or
religion, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I have a completely
unrelated degree, namely a Bachelor of Computer Science and Technology from the
University of Sydney.

I live in Sydney, Australia where unfortunately the Heathenry movement is
limited. Therefore I'm a solo practitioner at the moment though I post on the
Discord server Skíðblaðnir.

My surname [Ingram](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ingram) is derived from
Proto-Germanic *Ingwaz ("a Germanic god") + *hrabnaz ("raven"). My middle name
[Jeffrey](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Geoffrey) is an alternative form of
Geoffrey. Ultimately it originates from Proto-Germanic *gautaz ("Geat") +
*friþuz ("peace, sanctuary") making the Proto-Germanic term *Gautafriþuz
meaning "Great peace." My first name
[Jarrod](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jarrod) appears to have no etymological
origins.
